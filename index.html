                      <li>In a study of workers at Bell Telephone Laboratories, interviewers asked engineers in one division to identify stars among their peers. They came up with a short list of such stars and set out to determine how their work procedures differed from those of their nonstar counterparts. Surprisingly, the stars approached their work in ways that were not very different from the way their peers did. As a purely mechanical matter, they did the same work pretty much the same way as everyone else. But there were marked differences in how they managed their networks of connections, liaisons to fellow workers whose cooperation was required to get anything done. For example, people tended to return the starsâ telephone calls much more quickly. So a star, on average, would receive answers in twenty minutes, while the norm for the whole laboratory was more like four hours. Why did they get better attention from coworkers and colleagues? There was no obvious answer, but they did. Clearly, the stars had long before taken whatever steps were necessary to establish good connections. They had spread around favors, been responsive themselves, nursed relationships, seen to other peopleâs essential human needs.  DeMarco, Tom. Slack (pp. 106-107). Crown. Kindle Edition. </li>

                    Trust - no squelching no mocking âThe safety that is required for essential change is a sure sense that no one will be mocked, demeaned, or belittled while struggling to achieve renewed mastery. Sticks and Stones and Names So sticks and stones in the world of corporate change are survivable, but ânamesâ are killers. Irony and sarcasm, pointed jabbing criticism, personal mockery, public humiliation, exasperation, managerial tantrums, eye-rolling: These are the true enemies of essential change. To make an organization change-receptive, you need to rout all of these various kinds of disrespect from the culture. Replace them with a clearly felt sense that people at all levels are to be honored for the struggle theyâve been willing to take on. During change, every failure has to feel like a treasure (for the lessons it imparts). The person who fails is a hero, the backbone of the change effort. Failure gains that person more respect, not less.â

                    Team Work: Part of the reason is that the team helps align goals, helps to keep all members pulling in the same direction. It also satisfies some of the individualâs need for community. These are nontrivial advantages that go a long way to explaining the demonstrated advantages of teamwork in knowledge activities.DeMarco, Tom. Slack (p. 166). Crown. Kindle Edition.
